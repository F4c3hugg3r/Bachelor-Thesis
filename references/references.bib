In both, programmers have primitives and functions available that allow manipulating system memory and interacting directly with the underlying hardware, resulting in efficient code in both response times and resource use. On the other hand, it is a real challenge to generate code that is maintainable and scalable over time in these types of languages. In 2010, Rust emerged as a new programming language designed for concurrent and secure applications, which adopts features of procedural, object-oriented and functional languages. Among its design principles, Rust is aimed at matching C in terms of efficiency, but with increased code security and productivity. This paper presents a comparative study between C and Rust in terms of performance and programming effort, selecting as a case study the simulation of N computational bodies (N-Body), a popular problem in the HPC community. Based on the experimental work, it was possible to establish that Rust is a language that reduces programming effort while maintaining acceptable performance levels, meaning that it is a possible alternative to C for HPC.}, note={arXiv:2107.11912 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2107.11912}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Costanzo, Manuel and Rucci, Enzo and Naiouf, Marcelo and Giusti, Armando De}, year={2021}, month=oct }

  @article{Durumeric_Wustrow_Halderman, title={ZMap: Fast Internet-wide Scanning and Its Security Applications}, abstractNote={Internet-wide network scanning has numerous security applications, including exposing new vulnerabilities and tracking the adoption of defensive mechanisms, but probing the entire public address space with existing tools is both difﬁcult and slow. We introduce ZMap, a modular, open-source network scanner speciﬁcally architected to perform Internet-wide scans and capable of surveying the entire IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes from user space on a single machine, approaching the theoretical maximum speed of gigabit Ethernet. We present the scanner architecture, experimentally characterize its performance and accuracy, and explore the security implications of high speed Internet-scale network surveys, both offensive and defensive. We also discuss best practices for good Internet citizenship when performing Internet-wide surveys, informed by our own experiences conducting a long-term research survey over the past year.}, author={Durumeric, Zakir and Wustrow, Eric and Halderman, J Alex}, language={en} }

In this study, there is a focus on DDoS attacks and exploration of how various machine learning techniques may be leveraged to identify and mitigate them. Real world examples of major DDoS attacks that happened and reported or announced to the public were examined and it was found that in the last seven years, there has been an increase in the use of DDoS attacks to cause major disruptions to organizations. In a total of over 700 major cybersecurity incidents that we analyzed from 2015 to 2022, evidence of DDoS attacks were found every year. Hence, in that subset of dataset we examined, there was an increase from 8 to 31 major DDoS attacks from 2021 to 2022 which is an estimate of 288 percent increase. Due to the volume of network traffic analysis involved in the detection of DDoS events which more often may be very difficult for humans to manually or efficiently analyze, the validation of the importance of utilizing AI technologies such machine learning algorithms as effective capabilities for the detection of DDoS attacks and DDoS mitigation are assessed in this study. Identification of specific machine learning algorithms that may be used for the detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks were looked into. Given that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the mitigation of DDoS attacks, this study echoes the leveraging of the CIS Benchmarks and also encourages organizations to adopt referencing one of the NIST frameworks that was released to the public on January 26, 2023 titled “AI Risk Management Framework” as guidelines in ensuring multiple layers of controls in handling DDoS attacks.}, booktitle={2023 20th Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST)}, author={Falowo, Olufunsho I. and Okpala, Izunna and Kojo, Emmanuel and Azumah, Sylvia and Li, Chengcheng}, year={2023}, month=aug, pages={1–7} }

The authors investigate existing cyber threats, their impact on the economy of enterprises and offer recommendations on improving the level of information security in order to reduce economic risks. In the course of the research, a review of the literature was conducted, the main aspects of cybersecurity were considered — cybercrime, cyber espionage, attacks on critical infrastructure, as well as the complex economic consequences of cyber-attacks. The analysis of the current state of cybersecurity measures is carried out, the unevenness of their development between regions and the role of the pandemic in accelerating digitalization and the growth of cyber threats are noted. The main results of the study show that cyber threats have an impact on the financial stability and reputation of enterprises. Direct and indirect losses from cyber-attacks require increased investment in cybersecurity. The need for international cooperation and improvement of cybersecurity measures, including the development of human resources and the introduction of advanced technologies, is noted.}, journal={EKONOMIKA I UPRAVLENIE: PROBLEMY, RESHENIYA}, author={Rudnev, Sergey and Zolkin, Alexander and Artemyev, Nikolay and Tychkov, Alexander}, year={2024}, month=jan, pages={46–55} }

 @article{Nishanth_Reddy_Pinnapareddy_2025, title={eBPF for high-performance networking and security in cloud-native environments}, volume={15}, ISSN={25828185}, DOI={10.30574/ijsra.2025.15.2.1264}, abstractNote={Originally designed as a packet filtering framework, the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (EBPF) has since become a flexible and powerful networking, security, and observability tool at high performance in the cloud native ecosystem. EBPF is explored as this transformative technology has been partly adopted by cloud-native platforms such as Kubernetes to take advantage of the ability of EBPF in network optimization, security enforcement, and real-time monitoring without affecting system latency and employing its inefficient, kernel-level packet processing, which bypasses the bottlenecks of user space networking tools for better network throughput, lower latency, and better load balancing. EBPF-based security frameworks like Falco, Tetragon, and Tracee provide great capabilities for real-time threat detection and enforcement of security policy in kernel environments, making them suitable for dynamic cloud environments. These EBPF solutions are compared to traditional mechanisms such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems in terms of their effectiveness. It further explores the practices for deploying EBPF in Kubernetes environments, including micro-segmentation and zero-trust security policies. Besides that, the research compares some EBPF-based security frameworks and discusses their potential usage in real-world scenarios. This study examines the technical and practical implications of EBPF towards performance and security improvement for cloud-native infrastructures geared at cloud architects, security engineers, and DevOps engineers for EBPF. The findings indicate how EBPF can help tackle the scalability and performance concerns in contemporary distributed systems and ensure that EBPF will play an integral part in the future of cloud-native networking and security.}, number={2}, journal={International Journal of Science and Research Archive}, author={Nishanth Reddy Pinnapareddy}, year={2025}, month=may, pages={207–225} }

It enables modification, interaction, and kernel programmability at runtime. eBPF can be used to program the eXpress Data Path (XDP), a kernel network layer that processes packets closer to the NIC for fast packet processing. Developers can write programs in C or P4 languages and then compile to eBPF instructions, which can be processed by the kernel or by programmable devices (e.g., SmartNICs). Since its introduction in 2014, eBPF has been rapidly adopted by major companies such as Facebook, Cloudflare, and Netronome. Use cases include network monitoring, network traffic manipulation, load balancing, and system profiling.
